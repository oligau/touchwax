touchwax is a wireless DJ controller for Linux and Android. It
communicates with xwax DJ software using Open Sound Control messages.
It allows DJs to remotely control the position and pitch of a specific
deck using fingers. It aims to reduce latency to a minimum to enable a
similar feeling to vinyl or CDDJ control.
