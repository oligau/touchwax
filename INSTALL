The recommended way to build touchwax is to run "make" followed 
optionally by "make install" to install at the given prefix; eg.

  $ make PREFIX=/usr
  $ make PREFIX=/usr install  # as root

If PREFIX is not given, the user's home directory is used and "make
install" does not need to be run as root.

Compilation errors are most likely the result of missing
libraries. You need the libraries and header files installed for:

* liblo: http://liblo.sourceforge.net/
* libSDL 2.0: http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_ttf 2.0 (sometimes part of the SDL package, sometimes not)

These libraries are packaged with most Linux distributions and this is
the recommended way to install them.

For debian you need to run the following command as root to install 
development packages.
  $ apt-get install libsdl2-dev liblo-dev libsdlttf-dev
